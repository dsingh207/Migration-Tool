Problem Statement: Migration Tool for Cloud Infrastructure 

  

 Background 

Organizations are moving from on-premises systems to cloud-based infrastructure for scalability, cost efficiency, and security benefits. However, migration involves significant challenges. 

  

 Problem 

Current migration methods are: 

  

1. Error-Prone: Manual and semi-automated approaches lead to errors. 

2. Time-Consuming: Migration processes are lengthy and complex. 

3. Costly: High costs due to downtime and reconfiguration needs. 

  

 Objectives 

Develop an automated migration tool to: 

  

1. Data Compatibility: Convert and transfer data seamlessly. 

2. Minimize Downtime: Reduce system downtime during migration. 

3. Application Adaptation: Automatically reconfigure or translate legacy code. 

4. Enhance Performance: Optimize applications for cloud environments. 

5. Optimize Costs: Provide cost-effective migration solutions. 

  

 Impact 

The tool will streamline migration, reducing time, costs, and risks, and enable efficient modernization of IT infrastructure.
